# Plant-Co.-YTD-and-PYTD-Performance-Dashboards
This project allowed me to put my theoretical knowledge of Power BI into practical use. I worked exclusively within Power BI, using Power Query for all data transformation and cleaning - without relying on Excel or SQL. I developed calculated measures such as Year-to-Date (YTD) and Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD) for gross profit, quantity, and sales. These measures helped enhance the clarity and impact of the visualizations, making the insights more effective and easy to interpret.
